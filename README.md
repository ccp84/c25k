# MJ's c25k Registration App

## Concept 

This PP4 app will be a runner registration tool for c25k groups. 
* It will enable the club to advertise details of the next course and allow runners to sign up in readiness for the start date. 
* It will allow run leaders to advertise the details of each weeks date, time and start location. As well as a brief overview of the run. 
* It will allow logged in runners to sign up for posted runs, enabling run leaders to see who is planning on attending before setting off for each session. 
* It could also be used to mark runners as completed to maintain a list of graduates within the database, and list graduate runs following on from the main course. 
* It could be used for runners to add an emergency contact to their account which run leaders will be able to access during sessions in case of incident during the run. 
* The overall site will be styled in Joggers green and yellow on completion and function with mobile first design in mind.
